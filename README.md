# 3D Web Map of Literacy in Africa in the Context of Population Numbers and Density

A student project at ETH Zurich in 2017.

A live version of the web map is available via GitHub Pages at https://ciatheyes.github.io/LiteracyInAfrica/index.html. However, the data loads quite slowly. Thus, give it some seconds at the beginning and when you switch between views/data types or change the year. Moving around the globe and changing the zoom level may also help.

Bugs fixed in 2024.
