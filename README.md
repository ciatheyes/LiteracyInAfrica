# 3D Web Map of Literacy in Africa in the Context of Population Numbers

A student project at ETH Zurich in 2017.

A live version of the web map is available via GitHub Pages at https://ciatheyes.github.io/LiteracyInAfrica/Extrude.html. However, the data loading is quite slow. Thus, give it a few secons if you switch between views or change the year. Moving around the globe may also help.

Bugs fixed in 2024.
